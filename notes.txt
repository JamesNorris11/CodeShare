what class should things like addpost() and deletepost() methods be in? How should the class structure be?

https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/simple-php-class-based-querying--net-11863

classes:
post
db
person
and another one to have methods like addPost and deletePost?

error handling - check with classes not loading etc - document all of this

max limit on post (8000) and all other entry sizes

email confirmation - legit email address

error reporting - don't show?
