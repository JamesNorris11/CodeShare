PHP provides a built-in password hashing library that uses the bcrypt algorithm, currently considered the best algorithm for password hashing.

-- but not using a salt?
"Many sources will recommend that you also “salt” your password before hashing it.
That’s a great idea, and password_hash() already salts your password for you. That means that you don’t have to salt it yourself."
